# Synacor Challenge VM Implementation in Go

This is my work-in-progress implementation of a VM and text-based graphical 
debugger for the machine architecture described in the Synacor Challenge 
from OSCON 2012. The Synacor Challenge website is no longer alive, so I've 
been working from the archive at https://github.com/Aneurysm9/vm_challenge/tree/main. 

## TODOs

- Keybindings to:
  - Set breakpoints/run until breakpoint
  - Edit registers/stack/memory
